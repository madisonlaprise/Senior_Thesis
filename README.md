## Abstract:
The relationships between cognitive flexibility, depression, and social anxiety remain complex and poorly understood. This study utilizes a network analysis framework to examine how these constructs interact, with a focus on identifying key variables that may drive symptoms or resilience. Data were collected longitudinally and cross-sectionally, and metrics such as the Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) were analyzed for interconnected patterns.
Findings reveal that cognitive flexibility plays a central role in mediating the relationship between depression and social anxiety, with specific aspects of cognitive inflexibility associated with heightened symptom severity. This research highlights potential intervention targets, such as enhancing cognitive flexibility, to mitigate the shared and distinct impacts of depression and social anxiety symptoms. The implications for clinical practice and future research in psychological disorder networks are discussed.
